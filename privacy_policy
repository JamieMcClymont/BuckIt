# BuckIt – Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** 2025-09-30

BuckIt lets you create bucket lists and optionally send feedback to help improve the app.

## What we collect
When you submit feedback from inside the app, we collect:
- **Feedback text** (what you type)
- **Timestamp** (server time)
- **Anonymous user ID** (from Firebase Anonymous Auth; not personally identifying)
- **Platform** (e.g., iOS/Android)
- **App version** (if available)

We do **not** collect your contacts, precise location, photos, or other personal data.

## How we use your data
- To read and respond to feedback
- To improve app quality and features

## Legal basis (GDPR, if applicable)
- **Consent**: you choose to send feedback.
- **Legitimate interests**: improving BuckIt’s functionality and reliability.

## Sharing
We do **not** sell your data. We use third-party processors to store feedback:
- **Google Firebase / Cloud Firestore** (managed database and authentication)

These providers process data on our behalf under their own security and compliance programs.

## Data retention
Feedback may be retained as long as reasonably needed for app improvement.  
You can request deletion of specific feedback by contacting us (see Contact).

## Children
BuckIt is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has submitted feedback, contact us to remove it.

## Security
We use industry-standard safeguards and store feedback in Firebase. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

We may update this policy. We’ll change the “Effective date” above and post the new version at this URL.
